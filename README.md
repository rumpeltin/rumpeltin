Hallo, I’m @rumpeltin
- 🌱 Nov '22: Full-Stack Web Development course @CareerFoundry
- ☁️ May '23: In-Depth Cloud Engineering course @DigitalFutures

- Now I've acquired the ability to do an abundance of things:
  - Build secure websites that help buisnesses grow their influence while maintaining their integrity
  - Create an online presence from scratch and maintaining its allure in a novelty-orientated society
  - Navigate the relationship between the inherent logic and superficial grandeur of websites
- 👾 Apart from coding, I enjoy video games, cycling, reading, the visual arts and music.
- 📫 You can reach me via n.rumpeltin@proton.me
