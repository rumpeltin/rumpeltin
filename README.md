Hallo, Iâ€™m @rumpeltin
- ðŸŒ± On 29nd Nov, my Full-Stack Web Development course @CareerFoundry was kicked off.
- I'm hoping to learn an abundance of things:
  - How to build websites that help buisnesses grow their influence while maintaining their integrity..
  - Or how to create an online presence from scratch and maintaining its allure in a novelty-orientated environment!
  - And, of course, how to navigate the relationship between the inherent logic and superficial grandeur of websites.
- ðŸ‘¾ Apart from Web Dev I play video games, cycle a lot, love to read, enjoy photo- as well as videography and listen to music.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via n.rumpeltin@proton.me
